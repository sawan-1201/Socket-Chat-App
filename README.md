Chat App using socket.io Node.js

Socket IO is an event-driven framework used for bidirectional communication between a client and a server. It is mainly used for broadcasting messages to all connected clients in a particular server just like WhatsApp group chats. This framework is event-driven, which means that the client and server will respond to events sent by each other. In this article, we will see how to build a chat app using socket.io and Node JS. As Node JS can handle events, socket.io serves as a great framework for integration with Node JS.

Approach: We will build a web interface for the user to chat through. We will provide text boxes to the user to provide his name and the message that he wants. Then, through the use of socket.io events in Node JS, we will broadcast the messages using our server and display them in the command line or terminal.

Building a real-time chat app with Socket.io and Node.js is an excellent way to learn full-stack development.
